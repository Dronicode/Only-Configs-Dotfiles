# Only-Configs Dotfiles

Docs live at <https://cheatsheets.dronico.net> and the source is on GitHub: <https://github.com/Dronicode/Only-Configs-Dotfiles>.

Quick start:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dronicode/Only-Configs-Dotfiles.git
cd Only-Configs-Dotfiles
./deploy-dotfiles.sh
```

The deploy script installs dependencies and creates symlinks for the configs; it will also offer to set zsh as your default shell.
